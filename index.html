        <p>Project 1: <a href="https://meepiable.github.io/cheese/">Slava's Pizzaz</a></p>

<p>Description: This is my first project I uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub websites</a>. This project is about a pizza place called <em><em>Slava's Pizzaz</em></em>. You get to be the customer and order infinity amount of pizzas, but you just have to pay for them! &gt;:)</p>

<p>Update notice: I am going to let you have more then one pizza type. (More tabs on the screen) I am also adding more flavours.</p>

<p>Project 2: <a href="https://meepiable.github.io/lunch/">The Lunch Game</a></p>

<p>Description: This is my second project created in jsfiddle. This project is you having $20 for school, and you have to buy lunches (sandwiches)everyday. Easy right? Not really because the lunch costs are random! t=This game includes luck and choice. Have fun! </p>

<p>Project 3: <a href="https://meepiable.github.io/Emotions/">The Emotion Game</a></p>

<p>Description: This is my third project I created in <a href="https://jsfiddle.net">jsfiddle</a>. This project is when you are sad, angry, or happy, it will give you advice. Please do not make fun of it because my friend and I worked so hard on it. Thank you for your cooperation. :)</p>

<p>Project 4: <a href="https://meepiable.github.io/ChemQuiz/">ChemQuiz</a></p>

<p>Description: This is my fourth project and my favorite out of the 4. It will ask you some chemistry questions. Try not to look the answers up unless you really really really don't know,(like question 6) but be careful! Don't mess up. If you do, you will start over! &gt;:) Hope you all enjoy! :) &lt;3</p>
